            Hi, Iâ€™m Sifen Fisaha â€” a self-taught front-end developer and a Civil
            and Architectural Engineering student at Adama Science and
            Technology University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and engaging user
            interfaces using modern technologies like{" "}
            <strong>
              {" "}
              React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, React Router, Zustand, Redux
              Toolkit, and Framer Motion.
            </strong>
            From smooth animations to clean component architecture, I enjoy
            crafting web experiences that are both functional and beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning to code has been one of the most rewarding challenges Iâ€™ve
            taken on. Iâ€™ve built several personal projects, learned how to
            manage state, work with reusable components, and write clean,
            maintainable code. Iâ€™m a fast learner, passionate about web
            technologies, and constantly pushing myself to grow.
