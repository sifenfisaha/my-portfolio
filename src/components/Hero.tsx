              Hi, Iâ€™m Sifen! Iâ€™m a self-taught front-end developer who loves
              turning ideas into real, usable things on the web. I care about
              clean code, good design, and making stuff that actually works.
              Still learning, always improvingâ€”but ready to build something
              awesome together. Letâ€™s create!
